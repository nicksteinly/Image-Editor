# Image-Editor

Computer Vision based image editor

TODO:

- \*\* if an image gets grayscaled, you must put it back in color so dimensions of image are 3 not 2
- fix the file/path assumption in Operations.py
- test all parameters inputs for operations
- error check the parameters inputs in the form
- drag and drop an image
- use Alert to display error popups on the UI
- add toggles for reordering operations

\*\* parameters in the JSON and python functions must follow same order so make them alphabetical in both since json alphabetizes
