# Image-Editor

Computer Vision based image editor

TODO:

- \*\* if an image gets grayscaled, you must put it back in color so dimensions of image are 3 not 2
- some images work for returning the parameter dependent operations other throw "cannot unpack non-iterable Response object"
- fix the file/path assumption in Operations.py
- test all parameters inputs for operations
- fix the remove operation bug
- make a list operations on an image work as opposed to just one
- make an image slide slow for each step
- error check the parameters inputs in the form
- drag and drop an image
- collapsable dropdowns for operation types like in net nutrition add meal
- use Alert to display error popups on the UI

\*\* parameters in the JSON and python functions must follow same order so make them alphabetical in both since json alphabetizes
