# Image-Editor

Computer Vision based image editor

TODO:

- fix/investigate bug with shifting input values after doing an image operation
- test all parameters inputs for operations
- fix the remove operation bug
- make a list operations on an image work as opposed to just one
- make an image slide slow for each step
- error check the parameters inputs in the form
- drag and drop an image
- collapsable dropdowns for operation types like in net nutrition add meal
- use Alert to display error popups on the UI

\*\* parameters in the JSON and python functions must follow same order so make them alphabetical in both since json alphabetizes
